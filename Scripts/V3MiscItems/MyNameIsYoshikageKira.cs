He works as an employee for a department store, and he get's home every day by 8PM atleast. He doesn't smoke, but he occasionally drinks. He gets in bed by 11PM, and he makes sure he gets eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a warm glass of milk, and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, he usually haves no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, he wakes without any fatigue or stress in the morning. He was told there was no issues at his last check up."

I take care not to trouble myself with enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night.
